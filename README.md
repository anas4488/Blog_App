# django_project_blogpage

> This is a django application which is a blog page with CRUD functionality and authentication. 

> Done with registration page and also used CRISPY forms which helps with bootstrap a lot when it comes to prettifying forms. 

> Made login and logout template. Did routing for both. Used login decorator(login_required) for authentication.  

> CRUD functionality added with user specific options. Also used **class based views** for making CRUD functionality.

> Tutorial by Corey Schafer (Youtube).
